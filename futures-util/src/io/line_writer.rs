/// Wraps a writer and buffers output to it, flushing whenever a newline
/// (`0x0a`, `'\n'`) is detected.
///
/// The [`BufWriter`][bufwriter] struct wraps a writer and buffers its output.
/// But it only does this batched write when it goes out of scope, or when the
/// internal buffer is full. Sometimes, you'd prefer to write each line as it's
/// completed, rather than the entire buffer at once. Enter `LineWriter`. It
/// does exactly that.
///
/// Like [`BufWriter`][bufwriter], a `LineWriter`â€™s buffer will also be flushed when the
/// `LineWriter` goes out of scope or when its internal buffer is full.
///
/// [bufwriter]: struct.BufWriter.html
///
/// If there's still a partial line in the buffer when the `LineWriter` is
/// dropped, it will flush those contents.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// We can use `LineWriter` to write one line at a time, significantly
/// reducing the number of actual writes to the file.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::fs::{self, File};
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
/// use std::io::LineWriter;
///
/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
///     let road_not_taken = b"I shall be telling this with a sigh
/// Somewhere ages and ages hence:
/// Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
/// I took the one less traveled by,
/// And that has made all the difference.";
///
///     let file = File::create("poem.txt")?;
///     let mut file = LineWriter::new(file);
///
///     file.write_all(b"I shall be telling this with a sigh")?;
///
///     // No bytes are written until a newline is encountered (or
///     // the internal buffer is filled).
///     assert_eq!(fs::read_to_string("poem.txt")?, "");
///     file.write_all(b"\n")?;
///     assert_eq!(
///         fs::read_to_string("poem.txt")?,
///         "I shall be telling this with a sigh\n",
///     );
///
///     // Write the rest of the poem.
///     file.write_all(b"Somewhere ages and ages hence:
/// Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
/// I took the one less traveled by,
/// And that has made all the difference.")?;
///
///     // The last line of the poem doesn't end in a newline, so
///     // we have to flush or drop the `LineWriter` to finish
///     // writing.
///     file.flush()?;
///
///     // Confirm the whole poem was written.
///     assert_eq!(fs::read("poem.txt")?, &road_not_taken[..]);
